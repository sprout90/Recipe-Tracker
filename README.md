# Recipe-Tracker

## What is it?
A web page that will track recipe data in the current state of a web page.  

## Why?
Provide practical application of React UI software development that implementes parent-child components, one-way data flow, props, event handlers, css, and state management.     

## My Focus
The focus on this exercise was to build an interactive web that form maintains state, responds to events, includes multiple components (single responsibility) and is styled appropriately. The starter project included a pre-build React app with starter components containing basic scaffolding, some (but not all) components, most of the required CSS, but no state or event management. I needed to make it work and look pretty.
